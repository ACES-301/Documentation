# Group Project: Team Agreement

### Group members: Andra, Camilla, Ezgi, Stacy

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.
Describe at least:

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Andra: Great written and verbal communicator, solid grasp of 301 concepts, back-end development
- Camilla: Project management, creative, CRUD methods
- Ezgi: Problem solving, logic, debugging
- Stacy: Enjoys working in React and front-end development, CRUD methods

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Our team is well-rounded and capable of effective collaboration. We can plug in our unique strengths to create a functioning, scalable, user-centered full-stack application. 

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Andra: Get more comfortable explaining programming concepts with correct technical terms, get more comfortable with front-end development
- Camilla: Push myself in front-end development and CSS, improve understand of how to integrate and connect components
- Ezgi: Get more experience and improve skills collaborating with a team
- Stacy: Improve creative problem solving skills

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Daily stand-ups
- Assign tasks on a kanban board through GitHub projects
- Open lines of communication for questions, clarifications, and blockers

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.
Describe at least:
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Make sure everyone understands what their responsibilities are, and ask for help when needed.
- Psychologically safe space for making mistakes, asking questions, bringing new ideas, giving and recieving feedback, and airing disagreements
- Recognize that everybody on the team wants the project to be successful

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Outlining boundaries and expectations will help prevent this
- Speak up

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Meet each other where we're at
- Let each team member lead out on what tasks they feel comfortable doing
- Pair programming in areas where one team member is not as fluent

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Outlining boundaries and expectations will help prevent this
- Check-ins
- One on one conversations

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- When: if we're nearing a deadline and things aren't getting done
- How: As a last resort, bring in instructor to help mediate

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.
Describe at least:
What hours will you be available to communicate?

Andra: Class time, only available Fridays and Sundays for emergencies
Camilla: Class time, flexible hours in afternoons, available Fridays and Sundays but not preferred
Ezgi: Class time, not available Fridays or Sundays
Stacy: Class time, some Fridays and Sundays

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Andra: Slack 
Camilla: Slack
Ezgi: Slack
Stacy: Slack

How often will you take breaks?

- Generally 10 minutes each hour or so
- As needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Get help from TA's
- Check-in with each other
- Pair or mob programming
- Focus on MVP

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- See first question under this section

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- Consensus decision-making
- Getting approval from team members
- Bringing concerns and questions to team members
- Psychologically safe place
- Emotional intelligence
- Remind ourselves that coding and working as a team are both challenging, it's okay to have hard days!

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- See above

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. 
This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.
NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.
Describe at least:

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Wireframe
- Domain Model
- Kanban board
- Daily stand-ups
- Camilla will take meeting notes and slack them to everybody
- Identify which team members will commit, PR, merge, etc.

What project management tool will be used?
- GitHub Projects
- Figma

## Presentation Deck
Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

[301 Final Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1owuw9oxLfqaur2ylPQmfUaTlH3pcv0tkZM_lrvhjqYw/edit?usp=sharing)

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:
Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- Front-end repo
- Back-end repo
- Documentation repo

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

- Organization, everyone is a collaborator

What is your Git flow?
- Main Branch
- Dev Branch
- Individual Feature Branches
- Communicate PR's, commits, merges, etc

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?

- 1 person outside of initial person who made the PR

Who merges PRs?

- Whoever is assigned to review the PR

How often will you merge?

- At the completion of each feature task, we will merge to dev branch

How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

- Slack
- Consensus that feature task is completed and tested
